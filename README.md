## Problem Statement: 
- Skilling : With rapid technological change, there is a growing disparity between the skills youth
possess and those required by the job market. Unequal access to skilling opportunities exacerbates this issue.
Furthermore, gender inequality and the lack of accessible training for disabled individuals deepen these gaps, limiting
opportunities for many. Tackling these problems is essential for creating a fair and inclusive job market.

## Our Solution:
### OVERTWISE
Every student aspires to receive a high-quality education from top-tier colleges, but only a small fraction actually secures admission to these prestigious institutions. For instance, the IITs admit just 0.08% of applicants. Unfortunately, in our country, access to excellent education remains limited for the majority of students. Amid this scarcity, there exist only a few ‘islands of excellence’ amidst a vast ocean of mediocrity. Additionally, academic freedom is often lacking.
In today’s rapidly evolving job market, there’s a notable skills gap between what young people 
possess and what employers seek. This gap is further widened by the lack of accessible training and 
unequal access to quality education. These challenges create a system where many talented 
individuals are left behind, unable to reach their full potential. It’s no coincidence that most students 
from top institutes like IIMs and IITs rarely fail in life. The quality education and exposure they receive 
prepare them comprehensively for life’s challenges.
