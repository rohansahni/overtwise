## Problem Statement: 
- Skilling : With rapid technological change, there is a growing disparity between the skills youth
possess and those required by the job market. Unequal access to skilling opportunities exacerbates this issue.
Furthermore, gender inequality and the lack of accessible training for disabled individuals deepen these gaps, limiting
opportunities for many. Tackling these problems is essential for creating a fair and inclusive job market.

## Our Solution:
### OVERTWISE
In today’s rapidly evolving job market, there’s a notable skills gap between what young people 
possess and what employers seek. This gap is further widened by the lack of accessible training and 
unequal access to quality education. These challenges create a system where many talented 
individuals are left behind, unable to reach their full potential. It’s no coincidence that most students 
from top institutes like IIMs and IITs rarely fail in life. The quality education and exposure they receive 
prepare them comprehensively for life’s challenges. 
OvertWise is here to change that. Our platform, with its mind map and community learning approach, 
is a groundbreaking solution dedicated to democratizing quality education. Inspired by prestigious 
institutions like IIMs, IITs, and Officer Training Academies, we aim to make top-tier educational 
experiences accessible to everyone, regardless of their background. OvertWise bridges the gap 
between potential and opportunity, ensuring that every motivated learner can access the knowledge 
and experiences needed to become exceptional professionals.
